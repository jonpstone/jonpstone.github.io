* When my car is running low on gas, I shake myself out of it after thinking that I could just fetch more gasoline from an API.

* When I look at my Son’s diaper pail, I sense that it’s rather similar to Redux, instead of your state all being in one place, it’s baby poop! Although I then think about how I actually wouldn’t want any value ‘returned’ from the pail…

Code life.

* I look at my desk at work like a DOM, I need ReactJS to only update parts of it. Like Windows 7. That’d be nice.

Code life.

* When telemarketers call me, they need to pass certain validations in order for me to not hang up.

Code life.

* Coffee helps me run faster, just like serialized data or concise, reusable chunks of code!

Code life.

* I have an association with my Wife and Son, presumably, we’re all associated through a join table somewhere using foreign keys.

Code life.
