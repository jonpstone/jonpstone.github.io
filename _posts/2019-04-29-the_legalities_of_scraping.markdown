So I'm going back a little here, way back to my CLI gem for Dog Parks, the first ever program I wrote from scratch in fact! However, I think this topic is interesting becasue content use was always at the back of my mind. Now for my project I was using city websites in the DFW area, which being government and displaying freely avaible data, seemed fine. There's also the fact that it only runs in the terminal, will only be viewed by my instructor, me and any potential employers... that helps too.

However, what if I want to do it for another website, for a project I wanted to deploy and/or to make money from? There's been a couple of articles I've been checking out, which cover the topic quite thoroughly. Rami Essaid at Distil Networks asks, when asked 'Is Web Scraping Illegal?' The answer is apparently that it depends on what the is IS. Quite... and it's been an issue going back for quite some [time](http://www.internetlibrary.com/pdf/efculturaltravel-zefer-1-cir.pdf).

There are several other high profile cases, like this [one](https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/08/14/hiqlinkedintro.pdf). Ultimately it remains something of a grey area, although legislation was passed a few years ago to try to provide clarity. 

To counteract this type of activity, the BOTS Act:

* Prohibits the circumvention of a security measure used to enforce ticket purchasing limits for an event with an attendance capacity of greater than 200 persons.
* 
* Prohibits the sale of an event ticket obtained through such a circumvention violation if the seller participated in, had the ability to control, or should have known about it.
* 
* Treats violations as unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The bill provides authority to the FTC and states to enforce against such violations.
